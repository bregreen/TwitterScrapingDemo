# TwitterScrapingDemo

**A demo by [Breanna E. Green ](https://bregreen.github.io/) // Powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/)** 

   This webpage contains materials for a simple introduction to scraping content from Twitter. I created it present to colleagues and friends at Cornell in 2021 Spring (so if you are seeing this many moons in the future... brace yourself for this relic). A quick snippet about me -- I am a PhD Student in the [Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/research) Department who's main research interest is how activist and extremist ideologies are developed and manifested online, particularly using social media.

# Acknowledgments
   I only learned how to develop this page after seeing the magnificent course materials of [Melanine Walsh](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Intro-Cultural-Analytics), who themselves cite the works of [Lauren Klein](https://github.com/laurenfklein/emory-qtm340), [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info3350/), and [Allison Parrish](https://github.com/aparrish/rwet). Many, many thanks for such a beautiful and informative site!
    
   Second, many thanks to friends in the [THE SOCIAL PERCEPTION AND INTERGROUP (IN)EQUALITY LAB](http://www.kroschlab.com/) for whom I motivated to work on this! Otherwise, it might have been a powerpoint. *Crowd boos in dissatisfaction.*
