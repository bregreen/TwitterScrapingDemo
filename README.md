# TwitterScrapingDemo

**A demo by [Breanna E. Green ](https://bregreen.github.io/) // Powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/)** 

   This webpage contains materials for a simple introduction to scraping content from Twitter. I created it present to colleagues and friends at Cornell in 2021 Spring (so if you are seeing this many moons in the future... brace yourself for this relic). A quick snippet about me -- I am a PhD Student in the [Information Science](https://infosci.cornell.edu/research) Department who's main research interest is how activist and extremist ideologies are developed and manifested online, particularly using social media.
